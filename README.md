## Interface Design for a Mobile IDE for Mobile Application

#uwaterloo class project; collaboration: Md Ismail Alam Mokul, Derrick M. Wang and Md Omor Faruk 

Mobile application development is usually done across multiple devices, but the processing power of modern day mobile devices is more than enough to handle the development process, not to mention the convenience it can bring by reducing the number of devices involved. The fact that no widely used development environment exists on mobile suggests there are major issues that prevent developers from using mobile devices to program. In this research, we reviewed literature and worked with developers and students to examine the potential concerns and expectations they may have towards the concept of single- device mobile development, and attempt to design an interface that addresses these concerns and expectations. This study shows that the developers do not refuse the concept of mobile application development in mobile IDE for any distinct issue other than the fact that they have never tried this method of development.
